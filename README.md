# FoldFish

This is my final submission for my final year's game design course! 

In each level, you control a 2D goldfish projected on a 3D origami-like model. In order to unlock doors and forge a path to the exit in each level, the player must click on various faces of the origami figure in order to fold them and connect edges.
